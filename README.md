## 💥 Introduction

Music World is web3 app built over Solana where anyone can add their favourite songs and see the other songs that are added by different people from around the globe.

## 👨‍💻 Inspiration
Music Artists are not offered much of monetary benefits and struggle for real money in this world. We wanted to create a app where artists can upload there songs and create a NFT out of songs and those NFTs can be traded and fans and normal people can buy those NFTs. The creator will get a definite percentage whenever NFT is traded or bought by anyone.

## 👀 What it does
Since we were very new to this field, blockchain and Solana we weren't able to pull off the selling and trading part. So we created a app where you can add your favourite songs and share with everyone.

## ⚒️ How we built it
We used React for frontend and Solana along with Anchor framework for storing the song details on Solana network and Phantom wallet for authentication and transactions.

## 😱 Challenges we ran into
We were beginners in this field and didn't had any prior experience working with Blockchain, web3, Solana and Anchor. We learnt a lot of new things during the building of this project.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
We didn't knew any of Solana and Anchor when we started the project so we are really proud of the final outcome that we were able to accomplish and complete the project as a usable prototype.

## 🤓 What we learned
We learned Solana development, communicating with Solana using JSON RPC from React frontend. Using the Anchor framework for Solana development, storing data over Solana network, connecting and authentication with Phantom wallet.

## 🚀 What's next for Music World
We aim to extend Music World to the vision and motivation we had initially while starting the project building phase that is getting monetary benefits to music artists. So trading and selling of music NFTs is the main objective of future aspects of Music World. Apart from that we can add features like chat between the people and artists and alot more.
